For the weight-tracking app, the primary goal was to help users monitor their weight progress and achieve their fitness goals. The app was designed to address the need for a simple, efficient way to track weight changes over time, set weight goals, and visualize progress.

### Requirements and Goals
The app required user registration and sign-in functionality to ensure personalized tracking. Key features included a calendar for daily entries, goal weight setting, weight tracking, and graphical representations of weight progress.

### Screens and Features
Essential screens included registration and login, a home screen with a calendar, a weight entry screen, a goal setting screen, and a progress graph. The UI was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, using clear navigation and intuitive input methods. This focus on user experience made the designs successful by ensuring users could quickly and easily interact with the app.

### Coding Approach
The coding process was approached methodically, starting with setting up the user authentication system, followed by developing the weight tracking and goal setting features. Agile techniques were employed, breaking down tasks into manageable parts and iterating based on feedback. This approach can be applied in future projects to maintain flexibility and adaptability.

### Testing and Importance
Testing involved unit tests and user acceptance testing to ensure each feature functioned correctly. This process was crucial for identifying and fixing bugs early, ensuring the app's reliability and user satisfaction. Testing revealed areas that needed refinement and validated the app's core functionalities.

### Full Design and Development Process
From initial planning to finalization, one significant challenge was ensuring the graphical representation of data was clear and accurate. Innovating with charting libraries and data visualization techniques helped overcome this hurdle.

### Demonstration of Skills
Particularly successful was the implementation of the progress graph, which effectively demonstrated my ability to integrate and utilize data visualization tools, showcasing my technical skills and understanding of user needs.
